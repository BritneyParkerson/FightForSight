		<h3>Korbyn's Story</h3>
		<p>Korbyn is a beautiful, sweet, vibrant 4 year old girl who loves life!
			In her 4 short years, she has been through so much more than many adults can imagine!
			When Korbyn was just 15 months old, she was diagnosed with Esotropia, a form of ocular motility disorder.
			Even since her diagnosis, Korbyn has worn glasses and has already reached the max prescription as well as bi-focals.
			A specialist has determined that Korbyn is in need of surgery before she loses her vision completely.
		</p>
		<span>Some of the symptoms this sweet little girl faces are:
			<li>Headaches (we adults can understand how awful those are!)</li>
			<li>Blurred vision</li>
			<li> and Crossed eyes</li>
		</span>

		<p> 
			Korbyn has an amazing family who have been working hard to get the best care for their sweet daughter!
			The surgery is scheduled for April 17, 2020 and this amazing family is in need of
			all help they can get to raise the funds to meet the insurance deductible!
			This surgery has already been prolonged long enough and this baby could use our help!
